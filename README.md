# LibGDX-AABB-Platformer
An AABB platformer template for your LibGDX games

Since this platformer template uses AABB, you can't have have your character or other objects move on slopes or rotated rectangles.
But if you're making a game that doesn't require it, this is a good repository to build your game off of.
